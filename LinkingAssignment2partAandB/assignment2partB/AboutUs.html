                <h4>Waterford Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was founded in 1870. It’s aim was to promote animal welfare in Waterford city and county and after nearly a century and a half, this still remains our purpose.</h4>
                <div class="ui list">

                    <div class="item">Waterford SPCA is a registered charity since 1921 (Chy no. 743) and is affiliated to the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.</div>

                    <div class="item">We strongly encourage the neutering of pets as a great deal of welfare problems amongst companion animals have their root in the breeding of unwanted animals. We run a neutering scheme whereby we contribute to the cost of neutering of pets for people who cannot afford the full price.</div>

                    <div class="item">We find homes for animals taken into our care, mainly as a result of cruelty, neglect and irresponsible breeding.</div>

                    <div class="item">Our aim is to educate the public and in particular young people about animal care and welfare. Visits to schools, clubs, and various community groups are arranged on request.</div>

                    <div class="item">Waterford SPCA is funded by grant funding, donations and the proceeds of fundraising events held throughout the year such as street collections, auctions, supermarket bagpacks, jumble sales etc.</div>

                    <div class="item">Donations by standing order are always welcome as knowing what income we can expect helps us plan for the future.</div>
                    <div class="item">The society’s office is at Summerland Square and is open Mon to Fri 10am to 2pm</div>
