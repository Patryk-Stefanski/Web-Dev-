                <p>Welcome to the website of the Waterford Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals also known as Waterford SPCA. We are a registered charity (Charity No. 743) and a non-profit organisation dedicated to preventing cruelty, abuse and neglect of animals. We deal with horses, dogs, cats, birds, wild animals, marine animals and exotic pets.</p>

                <p>We run education and information programmes that promote and advocate good animal welfare and responsible pet ownership. We have a fully licensed welfare inspector who responds to calls from the public regarding the welfare of animals large and small, domestic and wild.</p>

                <p>Our kennels look after dogs who have been abandoned and abused. Our kennels rehabilitate these animals and prepare them for their forever homes. All dogs are chipped, vaccinated and neutered before being rehomed. A home check is done to ensure that the new homes are safe and suitable for our beloved rescue animals.</p>

                <p>We run a very successful feral cat neutering scheme and through it have reduced tens of thousands of unwanted cat pregnancies and untold amounts of suffering.</p>

                <p>We are affiliated to ISPCA. A team of volunteers are actively involved in fundraising for the society all year round.</p>
